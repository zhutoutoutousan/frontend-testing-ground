Pacific National is leveraging the global Avetta best practice approach to ESG to develop and implement a strategic, managed approach to its sustainability-led initiatives.\n</p>\n<blockquote></blockquote>\n<p>\n“We’re excited to partner with Avetta to build on our supplier commitments to support our three pillars of ESG: emphasising social responsibility in our communities, minimising our environmental impact and protecting the health and safety of our employees throughout our supply base,” said Zelda Pretorius-Kovacs, Pacific National Head of Procurement.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Reducing Risk While Achieving Compliance Goals</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nFor multinationals, up to 90% of their environmental footprint is in the supply chain. But most companies do not have the visibility into sustainability readiness and goals of each supplier. This situation increases the risks of unknowingly taking on unethical work practices, using protected resources and contributing to global climate change, leading to potential regulatory penalties, civil and criminal liability, and brand and reputation damage.\n</p>\n<p>\nAvetta’s sustainability and ESG solution solves this challenge by providing suppliers with analytics, sustainability ratings and maturity scores based on specific ESG standards and goals, such as Value Reporting Foundation (VRF – formerly SASB), Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), and Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).\n</p>\n<p>\nKey features of the solution that help companies to simplify their ESG compliance include:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\nScoring ESG maturity: Avetta calculates an ESG Index that characterises supplier levels of awareness and understanding by measuring ESG compliance across a range of global and specific company standards in 20 industries. To create these measures, Avetta provides analytics reports to help organisations determine which suppliers apply to which ESG requirements, based on company goals, multiple standards and codes of conduct. Suppliers are then guided through the registration process and evaluation completion based on their maturity levels.\n</li>\n<li>\nAccurately measure and remediate ESG compliance: A scorecard shows the status and progress toward improvement. These capabilities enable companies to accurately measure and quickly remediate ESG compliance issues, reducing immediate risks while more quickly achieving long-term goals. Clients can then collaborate with suppliers to remediate gaps. The platform helps them optimize resource allocation, enable stakeholder awareness and source new suppliers from the network.\n</li>\n<li>\nEnable data-driven decisions: Avetta’s platform leverages detailed analytics to target areas of concern, highlight achievements, and facilitate better corporate reporting and ongoing development of ESG and sustainability performance.\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\nAccording to McKinsey &amp; Company, organisations that fulfill ESG criteria see an overall cost reduction of up to 10%. In addition, ESG-focused management hedges against possible risk factors surrounding regulations and policy changes. Members on the Avetta One platform outperform industry standards and also reduce administrative expenses on average by 75%.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Suppliers using Avetta One can showcase their maturity in the ESG space, making them reliable partners to work with, as well as discoverable and attractive to clients from a financial investment standpoint,” said Adam Boyle, Avetta SVP APAC and Managing Director.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Single Platform to Manage Multiple Areas of Supply Chain Risk</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Avetta One Platform is the industry’s largest and most comprehensive supply chain risk management platform. The platform delivers a unified view of supply chain risks across safety and health, liability, workforce management, sustainability and ESG, diversity and inclusion, financial viability and cybersecurity. Avetta One also helps suppliers by quickly quantifying their compliance ratings and benefits workers by offering a central workforce portal to digitally store required job roles, training, competencies and certifications.
